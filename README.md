## RAO - Room Allocation Optimiser using React-redux
A React-redux application to optimise the allocation process of the rooms.

## Installation
To get started, open terminal and do-what-i-say
```bash
$ git 
$ npm install
```

## How to launch ?

Open the terminal and run below npm command
```bash
$ npm start
```

This command would trigger the npm script, which would launch the server automatically and will start the app at port 3000 on http://localhost (http://locahost:3000)

Start entering the no of available rooms under each category (economy and premium) and then click button "Submit Allocation". The RAO(ROOM Allocation Optimiser) alogorithm will run on the background and would show the best possible room allocation (across both categories) to the user. It will also show the total tariff across economy and premium class, if the rooms are allocated as per the RAO results.

## How to run the test case or view code coverage.

In order to just run the test cases open the terminal and run below npm command
```bash
$ npm test
```

To generate production level code(bundled => minified => uglified),run below npm command and follow the instructions on the terminal to host the production build on server(eg. Github Pages)
```bash
$ npm run build
```
